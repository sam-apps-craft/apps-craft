            Balancing my life between the UK and France, with family ties in
            both, my French home is in the South near Avignon and my UK home in
            the North near York. After bidding farewell to an international
            sales role amidst the challenges of Brexit and shifting trade
            conditions, I felt compelled to venture into the world of mobile
            application development. With no prior coding or web development
            skills, the prospect initially seemed daunting. However, determined
            to explore this new path, I sought out training courses and
            discovered SheCodes. A free 1-hour tutorial was all it took to
            captivate me completely. Having now completed several workshops, I
            wholeheartedly recommend SheCodes to anyone eager to learn coding,
            seeking a career change, or looking to enhance their coding skills.
            My future is shaping up to be brighter, more interesting,
            challenging, and, most importantly, fun! I plan to work for myself
            and my new venture is called Apps-Craft and I look forward to the
            exciting journey of launching my company in the near future !!!
